# delta0 — Orientation Reset (v0.1)

## Purpose
Return attention to the present moment without judgment — in stillness or in motion.

## Best used when
- you’re drifting, scrolling, or mentally “elsewhere”
- you feel overstimulated or emotionally charged
- you want to come back to your body gently

## Setup
- Posture: any (sitting, standing, walking, light movement)
- Duration: ~60–90 seconds
- Effort: low

## Voice direction
Warm. Neutral. Minimal.
No forcing calm — just restoring orientation.

> Your breath. Your hands. Your steps.  
>   
> [pause 5 seconds]  
> Nothing needs to be fixed in this moment.  
>   
> [pause 4 seconds]  
> Just stay with what’s real.  
>   
> [pause 5 seconds]  
> If your mind runs ahead, that’s okay.

>   
> [pause 6 seconds]  
> You’re not behind.  
> You’re here.

## Integration
Keep doing what you’re doing — but let attention ride the movement.
One breath. One step. One moment at a time.

## Notes for v0.2
- tighten any line that feels “too poetic”
- adjust pauses based on how it sounds recorded
