# delta0 — Orientation Reset (v0.2)

## Purpose
Restore present-moment orientation without judgment — in stillness or in motion.

## Best used when
- attention feels scattered or unfocused
- you’re overstimulated or emotionally charged
- you want to come back into your body without effort

## Setup
- Posture: any (sitting, standing, walking, light movement)
- Duration: ~60–90 seconds
- Effort: minimal

## Voice direction
Warm. Neutral. Clear.
No calming performance. Just orientation.
